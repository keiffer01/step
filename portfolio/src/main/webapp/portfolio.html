        <p>This website was created as part of training during Google's 2020 STEP Summer internship. It was created completely from scratch without the use of any frameworks. Currently, I'd still consider it a work-in-progress and will likely continue to add to and update it throughout the future.</p>

        <p>PointMe is a project created by a team of 4 in the HackCMU 2019 hackathon, winning 2nd place overall. Having suffered with the workings of managing memory in C and growing frustrated with the cryptic messages being returned by valgrind, we wrote PointMe as a visual debugger to show you where on the stack and the heap variables were located, as well as which pointers referenced what. I contributed to part of the project that involved parsing the contents of the .c file before passing them on to the frontend.</p>
