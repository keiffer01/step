          This website was created as part of training during Google's 2020
          STEP Summer internship. It was created completely from scratch
          without the use of any frameworks. Currently, I'd still consider
          it a work-in-progress and will likely continue to add to and update
          it throughout the future.

        <p>
          PointMe is a project created by a team of 4 in the HackCMU 2019
          hackathon, winning 2nd place overall. Having suffered with the
          workings of managing memory in C and growing frustrated with the
          cryptic messages being returned by valgrind, we wrote PointMe as a
          visual debugger to show you where on the stack and the heap variables
          were located, as well as which pointers referenced what. I contributed
          to part of the project that involved parsing the contents of the .c
          file before passing them on to the frontend.
